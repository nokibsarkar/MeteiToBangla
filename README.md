# MeiteiToBangla
This Python module was created to facilitate the conversion of Monipuri Language (`mni`) from Meitei Mayek script to Bengali script. The module is based on the Unicode standard for Meitei Mayek script and the Unicode standard for Bengali script. The module is designed to be used with Python 3.6 or later.
I kindly thank the following people for their help in creating this module:
1. [Haoreima](https://mni.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Haoreima) for the Meitei Mayek to Bangla rules and the Meitei Mayek Unicode standard.
